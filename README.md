-Consolidated excess lines of HTML into one line to make it clear what was tied together
-Added div id to correctly link the search-engine-optimization link to the correct part of the page
-Combined some of the extra css lines that were repeats of themselves


-authors note to graders: I wasn't sure how much of the code I should rewrite for this, so I didn't clean the CSS up in a way that would've required me making entire rewrites of the HTML code. Let me know if you would prefer I did so, and I will resubmit with that done.
